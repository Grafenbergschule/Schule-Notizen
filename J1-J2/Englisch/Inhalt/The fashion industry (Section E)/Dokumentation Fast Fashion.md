- SHEIN represents an ultra-fast fashion model that floods the market with thousands of new, very cheap items in extremely short production cycles, pushing constant overconsumption.​
    
- This business model leads to huge amounts of low-quality clothing that are quickly discarded, significantly increasing global textile waste and overloading landfills and incinerators.​
    
- The production of SHEIN’s garments consumes large quantities of energy and water and causes substantial greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change.​
    
- Synthetic materials like polyester dominate many SHEIN products; these fabrics shed microplastics and contain chemicals that pollute rivers, oceans, and soils during production and washing.​
    
- Workers in supply chains often face low wages and poor working conditions, as extreme price and time pressure are built into the ultra-fast fashion system.​[](https://www.greenpeace.de/publikationen/S04261_Konsumwende_StudieEN_Mehr%20Schein_v9.pdf)​
    
- Influencer marketing and heavy discounting specifically target young consumers, normalizing frequent “haul” shopping and a throwaway culture of clothing.[](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DS2gSVAj4am/)​​
    
- The documentary highlights that SHEIN symbolizes how the fashion industry has become one of the most environmentally damaging sectors worldwide.​
    
- It points to alternatives such as buying secondhand, purchasing fewer but higher-quality items, and introducing stricter regulations on chemicals and textile waste to reduce fashion’s footprint.​​
