Dear Lidl, 

I have some terrible news for you. Lidl, being one of the supermarkets most mindful of their green, ecological image, the progress in the technology of genetically modified food (GM food) isn't very convenient. As soon as there is even one vegetable in the shelves of our local Lidl, which is *genetically modified*, the marketing chief of Lidl would probably suffer his darkest nightmares. GM food seems to be bad just because it isn't natural. It conflicts with the image of the farmer that doesn't corrupt, the way of crops finding their own way out of the soil, bringing as much harvest as the plant likes. That's the illusion of the marketing of Lidl is trying to sell the customer. 

This illusion is not only hypocritical, but also harmful. Looking behind the wall of marketing, food isn't produced like this at all. And this is not a problem in the slightest. Tweaking the conditions and the plant itself is a good thing.
